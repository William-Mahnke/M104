# M104
Repository containing my coding files for the MATH 104 series (M104A, M104B, M104C)

M104A Files:
* Bisection.py: small file containing a basic script for the bisection method used to find roots for a function over a specified interval
* CP1.py: final product for my first class project. worked in a group to compare the bisection method to newton's method when looking for roots of a function. compared final results, computational time, and convergence of the methods
* CP2.py:  final product for my second class project. worked in a group to compare the Adam-Bashforth and Adam-Moulton methods for approximating ODEs.
* CubeRoot.ipynb: script designed to use Newton's method to find the cube root of a value
* Lecture2.ipynb: brief script summarizing list splicing
* NewtonCotes.ipynb: notes and scripts about using Newton-Cotes and other related methods to approximate the integral of a function over a finite interval
* hw3.py: script developed for a homework assignment 

M104B Files:
* CP2.ipynb: final product of second class project. worked in a group to compare methods used in approximating answers to a specific PDE.
* FDM_Poisson_Eq.ipynb: notebook for notes on using the Finite Difference Method to solve the Poisson equation
* FDM_WaveEq.ipynb: notebook for notes on using the Finite Difference Method to solve the wave equation
* FDMforPDEs.ipynb: notebook for notes on using the Finite Difference Method to solve the heat equation
* HW2.ipynb - HW9.ipynb: notebooks used to complete homework assignments. topics within each assignment vary
* internallib.py: python script with functions for the secand method (root finding), RK4 (ODE approximation), creating a tridiagonal matrix, and conjugate gradient method (solving systems of linear equations)
